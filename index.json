This is accomplished in part through the training of ARES volunteers in communication procedures, national operational structures as required by FEMA (NIMS, ICS, etc.) and the development of the technical skills necessary to complete their communications mission under a variety of situations including possible adverse communications conditions.\nIn the course of filling our mission, the volunteer personnel of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) provides the services and personal equipment to the community at no cost. The service is neither taxpayer-supported nor is compensation normally allowed. The Amateur Radio Emergency Service is part of the American Radio Relay League, the national association of the radio amateurs which is a signatory to a Statement of Affiliation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
